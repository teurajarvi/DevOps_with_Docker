We’ve left containers and a image that won’t be used anymore and are taking space, as docker ps -a and 
docker images will reveal. Clean the docker daemon from all images and containers.

Prove that you have completed this part of exercise by delivering the output for docker ps -a and docker images

~$ sudo docker container ls -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
~$
