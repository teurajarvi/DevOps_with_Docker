This exercise is mandatory

A good developer creates well written READMEs that can be used to create Dockerfiles with ease.

Clone, fork or download a project from https://github.com/docker-hy/frontend-example-docker.

Create a Dockerfile for the project and give a command so that the project runs in a docker container with 
port 5000 exposed and published so when you start the container and navigate to 
http://localhost:5000 you will see message if youâ€™re successful.

Submit the Dockerfile.

Do not alter the code of the project
    TIP: The project has install instructions in README.
    TIP: Note that the app starts to accept connections when Accepting connections at 
         http://localhost:5000 has been printed to the screen, this a few seconds
    TIP: You do not have to install anything new outside containers.
