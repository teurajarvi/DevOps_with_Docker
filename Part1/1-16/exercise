Pushing to heroku happens in a same way. A project has already been prepared at devopsdockeruh/heroku-example so 
lets pull that first. Note that the image of the project is quite large.

Go to https://www.heroku.com/ and create a new app there and install heroku CLI. You can find additional instructions 
from Deploy tab under Container Registry. Tag the pulled image as registry.heroku.com/<app>/<process-type>, 
process-type can be web for this exercise. The app should be your project name in heroku.

Then push the image to heroku with docker push registry.heroku.com/<app>/web and release it using the heroku CLI: 
heroku container:release web (you might need to login first: heroku container:login)

For this exercise return the url in which the released application is.

You could also use the heroku CLI to build and push, but since we didnâ€™t want to build anything this time it was 
easier to just tag the image.
